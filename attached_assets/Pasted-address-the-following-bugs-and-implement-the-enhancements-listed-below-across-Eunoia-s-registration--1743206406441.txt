address the following bugs and implement the enhancements listed below across Eunoia’s registration, onboarding, subscription flow, and landing screen. All features must be mobile-responsive and include smooth, modern animations.

## 🔐 Registration Improvements

- Show an **inline error** if the passwords do not match in real-time.
- If the **username is already taken**, display a clear inline validation message without requiring form submission.
- Ensure form validations are smooth and user-friendly.

This flow should be **triggered immediately after a user successfully creates an account**, before entering the home page.

### Page 1 – Welcome to Eunoia

- Tagline: *“Writing the story of you”*
- Include a brief mission statement about mindfulness, intentional journaling, and personal growth.

- Full-screen layout with inviting visuals and soft motion.

### Page 2 – Benefits & Goal Commitment

- Prompt the user to **commit to a journaling goal** via a friendly UI (e.g., goal selector, animated cards, or slider).
- Use interactive or scroll-triggered animations to keep it lively.
- Ensure layout looks clean on small mobile devices.

### Page 3 – Subscription Plans
- Clearly display **Free vs Premium** plan comparison.
- Include an **FAQ section** below the plans to address common questions.
- Add two main CTA buttons:
  - **Continue with Free** → direct to the home screen.

    - After successful payment, route to the home screen.
- Use visual transitions and animated toggles between plan tiers.
