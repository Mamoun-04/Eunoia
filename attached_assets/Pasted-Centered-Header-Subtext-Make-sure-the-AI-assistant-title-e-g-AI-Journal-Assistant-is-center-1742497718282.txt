Centered Header & Subtext

Make sure the AI assistant title (e.g., "AI Journal Assistant") is centered at the top.
Subtext should be slightly smaller but readable.
Message Box Styling

The welcome message should be inside a rounded, slightly translucent box with proper padding.
The text should be well-spaced and broken into shorter paragraphs for readability.
Background Contrast

Ensure that the background behind the message is slightly darker than the chat bubble for contrast.
Subtle textures or patterns can help separate sections.
Chat Input Position

The chat input should always stay fixed at the bottom so it’s accessible without scrolling.
The "Send" button should be compact and aligned properly within the input box.
Message Alignment & Sizing

Messages should have consistent padding and spacing.
Text should not stretch too wide, ensuring readability on smaller screens.
Responsive Adjustments

Make sure the page adapts seamlessly between different screen sizes (iPhone, iPad, etc.).
Use max-width and min-height properties to keep messages readable without taking up too much space.
Dark Mode Optimization

Ensure text is crisp and readable in both light and dark modes.
Avoid too much contrast strain (e.g., overly bright text on dark backgrounds).

Ok actually make the ai assistant a floating button like we did with the sacred verses

Got it! Here’s how the AI Assistant should be implemented as a floating button, similar to The Sacred Verses:

Changes to Implement:
Floating Button

The AI Assistant should not be in the bottom nav.
Instead, have a floating button in the bottom-right corner (similar to chat apps like WhatsApp).
Button should have a simple icon (speech bubble or message icon).
Expandable AI Chat Panel

When tapped, the floating button should open a modal-style chat panel (just like The Sacred Verses assistant).
It should slide up smoothly and not take over the entire screen (about 70% height max).
Background behind should dim slightly for better focus.
Persistent Access

The floating button should be visible across all tabs (Today, Entries, Settings, etc.)
This allows users to access AI journaling assistance anytime without leaving their page.
Close Button & UX

The AI Assistant should have a clear close button (X) to dismiss it.
If closed, the user should still be able to reopen it from the floating button without losing past messages.
Smooth Mobile Optimization

The chat should be well-sized for mobile, iPad, and desktop.
On mobile: max height 70%, scrollable messages.
On larger screens: Chat window can be wider but still not full screen.
