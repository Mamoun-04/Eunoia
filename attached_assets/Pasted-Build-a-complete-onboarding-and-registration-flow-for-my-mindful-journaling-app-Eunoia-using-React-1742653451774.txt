Build a complete onboarding and registration flow for my mindful journaling app, Eunoia, using React (or Next.js) and Tailwind CSS. The design should be elegant, calm, mobile-friendly, and consistent with a premium journaling experience.

Step-by-Step Flow:

1. Splash Screen

Show the Eunoia logo centered on a soft off-white background (#f9f7f1)

Include a smooth fade-in or scale-up animation

After 2 seconds, automatically redirect to the Welcome screen

2. Welcome Screen

Display a message: “Welcome to Eunoia – your space for mindful reflection”

Include a “Get Started” button

3. Profile Setup

Input fields: Name, profile photo (upload), and short bio

Include a “Skip” option

4. Goal Setting

Ask: “What’s your journaling goal?”

Provide options like:

Journal daily for 5 days

Journal every day for 1 week

Write 100 words a day

Include a custom goal input

5. Interest Selection

Multi-select options: Mindfulness, Gratitude, Healing, Productivity, Reflection, etc.

Use clean pill-style toggle buttons

6. Subscription Page

Title: “Unlock Your Mindful Journey”

Show three plans in a three-column layout:

Free Plan ($0/month) – limited access

Monthly Plan ($3.99/month) – 7-day free trial

Yearly Plan ($39.99/year) – highlight as “Best Value”

Clearly list features for each plan

Add CTA buttons under each plan

7. Create Account

After selecting a plan, prompt user to create an account

Input fields:

Email

Username

Password

Confirm Password

Validate email format and matching passwords

On submit, create account, log user in automatically, and redirect to the main app

8. App Access and Redirection

Based on the selected plan, provide access:

Free plan: Limited features, some features blurred or disabled

Monthly, Yearly, or Free Trial: Full access to all features

Automatically redirect users into the dashboard after account creation

Navigation Requirements:

Users should be able to navigate back and forth between any onboarding step

Use a visible progress bar or step indicator

Clean, modern, and minimalist interface

Soothing serif typography (e.g., Playfair Display for headers)

Soft transitions and clear visual hierarchy

Fully responsive and mobile-first layout
